# Contributing

Do you want to contribute? I'd love that.

## How?

If you want to add an entry to the `README.md`:

- is the entry valuable to people trying to get things done in Rust?
- if yes, use the template `[XXX/YYY](https://github.com/XXX/YYY) [[Crate](https://crates.io/crates/YYY/)] â€” DESCRIPTION [<img src="https://travis-ci.org/XXX/YYY.svg?branch=master">](https://travis-ci.org/XXX/YYY)`
- pay attention to the alphabetical ordering
